This dataset is provided as a subset of photos from a much larger dataset of approximately 25 thousands.\n\nThe dataset contains **24,998 images**, split into **12,499 Cat images** and **12,499 Dog images**. The training images are divided equally between cat and dog images, while the test images are not labeled. This allows users to evaluate their models on unseen data.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F7367057%2F498b0fc0a7a8cf40ac4337da82a4ebc5%2Fhow-to-introduce-a-dog-to-a-cat-blog-cover.webp?generation=1696702214010539\u0026alt=media)"}
